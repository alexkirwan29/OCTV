# OCTV - Original Content Television

Showcasing original content from amateur filmographers

## The Vision

Have a fair system that promotes amateur filmographers. Upload your films and them rated by other like minded users. This platform allows users to upload high quality content for the world to see. Along with the general public, professional filmographers will be lurking and spotting the next film picasso.
